# Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient using Logistic Regression. The model is built and evaluated using data analysis techniques.

## Project Overview

Heart disease is a significant cause of death globally. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health parameters. 

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various health metrics such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc. 

## Methodology

1. **Data Analysis**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and relationships.
2. **Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
3. **Model Building**: Using Logistic Regression to build the predictive model.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
