# Breast Cancer Predictor

## Overview

The Breast Cancer Predictor is a machine learning tool developed to assist in the early detection of breast cancer using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. This project achieves an impressive accuracy of **94%**, providing a reliable solution for healthcare professionals to make informed decisions.

## Features

- **K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm**: Utilizes KNN for classification.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves an accuracy of **94%** on the test dataset.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for easy predictions.
- **Scalability**: Can be scaled with more data for improved accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for visualizations, if applicable)

## Dataset

The model is trained on the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset]([https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HCy7dO_EcGs8krKcdq7WL2R3Io6TAsFy?usp=sharing)). This dataset includes features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
