# Diabetes Prediction Model

This project is a **Diabetes Prediction Model** built using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**. It predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on specific medical information provided by the user.

## Model Overview

- **Model Type**: Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- **Accuracy**: The model has achieved an accuracy of **79%** on the test dataset.
- **Goal**: To predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes based on input medical parameters such as glucose level, BMI, age, etc.

## Project Links

- **Streamlit App**: You can access the deployed app and interact with the diabetes prediction model here:

## Features

- **User Input**: The app takes key medical information from the user, including:
  - Age
  - Blood pressure
  - Glucose level
  - BMI
  - Insulin level
  - Skin thickness
  - Diabetes pedigree function
- **Model Output**: The app predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on these inputs.

## How to Use

1. Visit the [Diabetes Prediction App](https://diabetes-prediction-app-2mjdmkfend9axacxyaecag.streamlit.app/).
2. Enter the required medical details.
3. Click on the "Predict" button to get the result.
4. The app will provide a prediction on whether the person is likely to have diabetes.

## Model Details

- **Input Features**: Several medical parameters.
- **Output**: Binary classification - Likely to have diabetes or not.
- **Model Architecture**: The model is built using Keras and TensorFlow to create an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
